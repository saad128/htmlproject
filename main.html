        <b>Abdul Sattar Edhi Attributes</b>
        <ul>
            <li>I do not have any formal education. What use is education when we do not become human beings? My school is the welfare of humanity</li>
            <li>Never take anyone's death to heart Bilquis. Remember God by the equality with which He implements it. Nobody is different, the richest to the poorest, from here to the end of the globe face it equally. What an example of equality.</li>
            <li>So, many years later there were many who still complained and questioned, 'Why must you pick up Christians and Hindus in your ambulance?' And I was saying, 'Because the ambulance is more Muslim than you'.</li>
            <li>Empty words and long praises do not impress God. Show Him your faith by your deeds.</li>
        </ul>
